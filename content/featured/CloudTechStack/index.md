My experience in the cloud is not limited to provider. Having worked with both [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)as well as [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=enas), I hold certifications in both platforms. I also have extensive experience building and maintaing local cloud infrastructure using the [Hashicorp Stack](https://www.hashicorp.com/).
