Using CI/CD Tools is an integral part of agile teams. I have used a plethora of different tools over the years, starting with a custom and complex Jenkins implementation, to a modern, cloud-based Gitlab and Github Actions environment. A key to keeping it all afloat, is good monitoring tools. Zabbix, Grafana, and Cloud Monitoring are just a a few of the tools I've become proficient in.
